# logistic_regression_and_naive_bayes

This repository contains code for:
1. Logistic Regression:
   - The code for Logistic Regression is based on the Fertility dataset. 
   - The code involves training a logistic regression model. 
   - The code uses two features: "age" (X_0) and "hrs_sitting" (X_1) from the dataset.

2. Naive Bayes:
   - The code involves training and evaluating two Naive Bayes models using the Breast Cancer dataset 
   - Gaussian Naive Bayes Model: 
     - This model is used for datasets where the features are continuous, following a Gaussian (normal) distribution. 
   - Categorical Naive Bayes Model: 
     - This model is used for datasets where the features are categorical or discrete.

All the models have been evaluated using the following performance metrics:
* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* ROC & AUC
* Log Loss
